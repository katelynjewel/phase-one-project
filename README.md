# Reason for the project: 
    This project was built in order to apply and showcase the skills we have learned and developed during our phase one training at the Software Engineering Live class - FlatIron Bootcamp (class of 09/21). These skills major in our use of JavaScript to manipulate and change the DOM, and also the use of HTML and CSS to develop and design webpages.

# Motivation for the project: 
    Taking a picture and freezing a moment reveals how RICH reality truly is.  My partner and I believe that our world is beautiful and one way to appreciate it's beauty is to look at pictures. Our main motivation for this project came from the popular Pinterest App which is known to display variety of pictures to it's users based on the user's interests. 

# Project Description: 
    Our webApp attempts to mirror what the Pinterest App does by displaying pictures related to the category a user selects. Currently, there are four different categories of pictures that can be selected from and an additional option to see a mix of those four. The functionality - which gives a user the option to select a category - was setup using the dropdown menu HTML element. 

    On page load, our webApp displays a default picture that we think is a light hearted joke. This default picture can be interacted with by liking, disliking, commenting, and "pinning" to the side of the page.

    Once a category is selected, the body of our webpage will load to display various pictures related to the category that has been selected. Based on the displayed pictures, the user can like, dislike, and comment on each picture displayed. Furthermore, the user can select their favorite picture - from the displayed collection - with a click on the "PickIt" button. The App will have the selected picture displayed on a sidebar at the right-side of the page. This displayed "favorite picture" can be changed by selecting another picture using the "PickIt" button on the picture. Only one image can be "pinned" at a time.When the favourite picture is also hovered on, it will zoom-in for more focus.

    The user can always go back to select another category and new pictures will populate on the page based on the new selection. 

    We created our own JSON database and populated it with pictures because it was challenging finding a public API that will provide us with the kind and quality of pictures that we wanted. Hence, The pictures that can be displayed on the App at this moment is limited to what we have in our database.


# Learnings and Struggles:
   During the course of building this project, we gathered more experience with handling and manipulating DOM elements, we learned how to build and host our db.json file and we also struggled a lot with our page styling on CSS. Due to our struggles with CSS, our current App is not quite what was original thought out.
